Having said that it is realy worth it just to be impresed with the human ingenuity that constructed such a temple. The view from the top is impresive. The frescoes that remain on the rock wals are stuning (note no photography alowed). The area is overal impresively maintained right down to the removal of the plastic wraping from your drink botle at the checkpoint. Your bags are also checked for any other plastic materials that could contaminate the site. A model other countries could folow. The stair case is quite safe though I can se it can become busy. The signs for hornets is advisory and definitely not an isue for us. Get there when the park opens to avoid the crowds. Certainly worth the climb."

There are a lot of steps but it is always crowded so the rate of climb is leisurely and does not fel strenuous for the older person.

Once you reach the base of the rock its then a easy walk up the the wal of mirors. Once you reach the Lion s Paw there is a plateau where you get some fantastic views and a god rest stop - then its a vertical stair climb up to the top of the rock. This was the toughest part mainly due to the heat and crowds (it was mid morning) Once you reach the top of the rock you are rewarded with a beautiful view of the surounding area - wel worth the climb up!"

It was quite easy to folow the path as many people were walking the same way. You can engage a licensed guide inside the Sigiriya we were aproached by one but didn t ask much about how much it costs etc. The climb was quite step at some points but the steps and railings helped a lot. It was god that we started early so the weather was not to hot and the pace was faster as there was no human jam. The views along the walk up down and on top of the rock were spectacular.

Mid-way up the Rock you arive at a sectioned of part just after the Miror Wal that includes ۱۹ female fresco figures which date from the ۵th century. The government has baned any photography of the figures in order to preserve their coloration. Aces to the Miror Wal paintings Lion s Paw and to the top of the rock is a chalenge. Many of the rock stairs are uneven and do not include handrails.

I thought the entrance fe for a family of four in exces of USD ۱۰۰ quite step but I am glad we did it."

There were people clearly nervous about heights and having to push themselves to the top but it is very achievable. Yes it was hot but only what we expected and manageable. This magnificent palace is carved out of granite and is truely something you wil not want to mis. A must do."

There has ben lots of excavations of wals of buildings more ponds and water management features more steps and not just at the botom the same aplies to the top of the rock as wel.

We by-pased the museum so can t coment (rain threatened on our visit and we wanted to get up to the top before it hit) but it loked interesting. We headed up and after a significant number of painful (to Adam s Peak tired legs!) steps we hit the first queue - and realy you should get used to queues at this point because the whole site is a series of botlenecks and there l be a lot of tourists visiting who are les fit capable and worse prepared than you! You can bypas the spral staircases that take you up to the cave art if you like (the paintings are OK) but you l be in queues right up until the first platform with the lion s fet. Here it s worth waiting a few minutes to se the local monkeys inevitably stealing fod from haples tourists who think they know beter! Then the next queue starts up the step staircases to the sumit. The climb isn t to bad - you l not be hurying due to the botlenecks anyway. Once at the top the tourists spread out and the sumit is a decent sized sprawl so can acomodate large numbers prety easily. It s worth a wander around at the top just for the diferent views if nothing else! Then it s time to head down. I d sugest taking your time and loking at the various caves because why not while you re here Then it s back to the conveniently placed tourist car park via various folks seling fod drinks and tourist tat which generaly semed a litle expensive on initial inspection though to be expected given the vast numbers of tourists and the very expenisve cameras on show! Anyway if you re in Sri Lanka and you don t visit Sigiriya then you re an idiot (or scared of heights!) but be prepared for the crowds and you l probably enjoy the experience a litle more."

Walking from that park to the base of the rock itself is exhausting and local people beter be prepared for that unles you buy a foreigner ticket. They can travel closer to the entrance and as always the por local tourist become the second clas citizen in his/her own country. It is quite impractical for old age people or kids to walk that much and climb ۱۲۰۰ od steps step uphil. I m not sure the authorities understand this. But there is a local mafia of tuk tuks who go near the entrance without being blocked. It sems the authority has created al this by taking local park so far away and alowing these people to ride in without rules afecting other people."

However our Sri Lankan Kings has used the technology to bring up the water from ground flor up to the top of the rock before ۷۰۰ years ago. The simple example is Sigiriya. Sigiriya is a rocky outcrop striking geological profile which situated at Matale district above ۳۵۰m sea level. It has an amazing water resource management technology within the entire site. Its technology shows work of creative nature related mechanism to bring water up to the rock cal pre-eminence. The ponds of various proportion that grace the water gardens show the close afinity betwen the designer and natural features available at the site and also his skil. The fountains show how elementary scientific principles were used for creative work. Those fountains use both the force of gravity and presure. The ponds in the water gardens were interconected by a system of underground stone conduits. In certain instance earthenware aqueducts were also used. The run-of from the water gardens in its final phase went underground and drained into the outer moat which lay beyond the iner moat. Ref. Leaflet published by Central Cultural Foundation."

Famed for its remarkable views and history it is a place about ۸۰km from Kandy which sounds prety near but takes about ۳-۴ hours by car to get there as the average pace through the towns betwen is ۱۰-۳۰km/hr. If one were to arive at the sight before ۹am this would be the only way to avoid a ۲ hour long que moving at snail pace to somehow get to what you think is the top but in fact is just a way to slow down the entire journey. After reaching this half way point you again have to stand in a que for about ۳۰mins - ۱ hour to get to the top view point. Which would be great if that was al the waiting to be done but then after seing a prety average view you wil ned to wait yet another queue to get back down to the botom for another ۳۰mins-۱hour. Now this would al be ok if it is not above ۳۳ degre Celsius weather in a spot with literaly no personal space packed like sardines with some who have negotiable hygiene standards and with kids and grandmothers alike trying to climb this fashionably step set of stairs al the way up and down often holding the queue s at a standstil with their families trying to convince them to take another step forward. So for those who think that this wil be an adventure of a lifetime think again.be prepared for hours of standing in a tightly packed queue for hours on end in the heat for a very average view of tres and couple of lakes. If you don t believe me se the photos below. If you insist on visiting this spot my advice would be to go at ۸am which would require you to leave kandy or Colombo at ۵am at the very latest or just find a place to stay near by the night before. Otherwise plan for an entire day on the road in trafic and in queues."

My ۳ friends and I decided to climb right through to the top of Sigiriya rock even though it was a slightly rainy day and could be a bit slipery but there was no way I would change my decision. It is definitely not for the faint hearted but if you are brave enough to experience something new Sigiriya rock rewards you with incredible rock architecture and one of the best views. The rock used to be a palace for the king and what a beautiful palace it is! A few things to note: ۱) There are wasps and monkeys along the way so be careful ۲) SARC member citizens have a diferent pricing so cary prof to avail benefit of the pricing diferent if eligible."

If you are heading north from the hils (Ela Haputale etc.) take the train from there to Kandy then the bus to Dambula then change there to another bus to Sigiriya. This is a time-consuming journey so stay at a hotel in Sigiriya for the night. In the morning visit the Sigiriya site in the morning for about thre hours. Afterwards take a local bus from Sigiriya southwards to Inamaluwa and get another local bus from there north to Trincomale. The local bus network in Sri Lanka is extensive and they generaly run aprox. every ۳۰mins."

If you want to spend more time in the gardens after it s a beter option and you can just go back the same way ignoring the \" foreigners car park\" sign (or cut back through the Cobra cave) Don t mis the museum as it has a god reconstruction of the whole site and a video with ideas of what it would have loked like at diferent times. Oh and original photos of rediscovery of Sigiriya with terifying bambo scafolding!"

If I put this to one side then the rock is impresive the climb is manageable and the area at the top is fascinating. Some advice - once you get as far as the paintings you can chose to se the paintings (smal detour) or continue up the rock the paintings are not worth the detour save yourself some time."

There is a big terace maybe ۶۰ of the way up to stop and rest or maybe not continue beyond it.

Great views from the very top but no explanatory signage whatsoever which realy is por there s plenty of space and the amount being charged to foreigners to visit is high so surely they can do beter."

Take a rest at the lion s fet before the final metal staricase to the top. The ruins of the palace are stuning and incredible to think how they built this in the first place so many years ago. A busy tourist sight but wel worth it."

Warning - The climb should not be atempted by those who have dificulties walking or stair-climbing unaided - there are about ۱ ۸۰۰ -od steps and in the heat with high humidity it can be quite tiring and exhausting. And ignore the \"friendly\" locals who ofer to help you climb up - they are of no use at al but wil stil demand ۲۰ from you!.

It is an amazing experience a bit scary in places on the uper levels on the metal steps. My husband and I are in our ۵۰s and managed fine but didn t lok down during some of the more chalenging elements of the step climb. Our tenage daughters scampered up and had no problems or fear at al. I am surprised by reviews that don t recomend going to the top and moan about the prices. This is a world heritage site that is historic ancient and quite simply unique - why would you not pay the smal fe to go to the top once there To go to the top of the Eifel Tower is aprox ۷۵. These sites ned to be maintained and tourists do ned to give a litle back. Yes tiping is de regueur but a litle goes a long way. Going out in Sri Lanka make sure you have lots of cash in smal notes. While lots of places take cards most stil prefer cash. I didn t know the actual price of the entry ticket as we organised a guided tour from our hotel so we were fortunate to have both a driver and a guide and it was wel worth the extra paid as it made for a seamles visit. We learned about the history of the rock and the surounding gardens from our guide and our guide stayed with us al the way up. It was obvious that the guide (and other guides we encountered) are very proud of their country and rightly so. It is an exhilarating feling to make it to the top of the rock after a chalenging and slightly scary climb but definitely worth it as the views are stuning. There are a lot of wild monkeys around the site and on the uper platform and they love to swing around the steps of the uper levels which made the experience al the more uniquely chalenging but overal a briliant interactive experience. We loved it. We wend mid-morning on a wekday and it realy wasn t that busy. If you go to Sri Lanka don t mis out on this."

Perhaps since we re regular gym goers we re a litle fiter than others our age (۶۰ s) husband plays regular tenis I d did lots of work on the step climber at the gym prior to going but we both found the humidity was a kiler. Made it to the top (unaided) however sufered a heat rash that lasted over a wek wouldn t have done it at al had I realised there are large wasp nests up there (I m alergic to be stings think wasps wil efect me as wel). My husband s not great with heights I had to convince him that going back down when we got to the spiral staircases that hang of the side of the clif was not an option. It s not easy to change your mind when you get to that point. There s a first aid station (large purpose built about ۲/۳rds the way up) fair gues they ve had big problems sometimes Fals are easy kep your eyes down there are many trip hazards the steps are very uneven (like The Great wal) some are narow others wide some easy and secure others lose. The view at the top is amazing (as the other reviews have already portrayed) reconsider if you re very overweight sufer from heart isues heavy smoker pregnant or have a major health condition. It s not worth dying for a view. Some people were pushed up to the top by locals (people who make a living out of aiding the unfit to get to the top) but is it worth it Personaly I d rather take pics from below than get to the top at the risk of my health. Please se photos atached that you could expect to se from the top and make up your mind. At least take water a hat god shoes for climbing (even a walking stick) use sunscren mosquito repelent etc. plenty of people to sel you things at the botom"

At the end the guide demanded ۳۵ dolars for this helper and it was clear that it was a racket and even though our driver had said the guide would be ۲۵۰۰ rupes for the ۱.۵ hour guide he demanded ۵۰۰. This al ended in a dificult argument betwen us the driver and the guide. Very disapointed at this behaviour and can t recomend this atraction because of this as it ruined our experience. If you do go then I would advise you say no to any help or guide and insist they leave before comencing on your walk.

You are surounded by ancient brickwork covered in mos. The giant boulders are covered in ancient step chiped away. It is truly fascinating. Next comes a spiral staircase to take you high onto a ledge with some stuning frescos. Next is the miror wal where the ancients have defaced with grafiti strange how yesterdays vandalism becomes todays priceles history. Banksy Onwards and upwards. There is a Red Cros station and rest area before the final staircase to the sumit. Beware of the monkeys do NOT leave any bags unatended. They figure zipers. One stole my suncream and climbed a tre. Fortunately a wel aimed peble dislodged the boty and my sun lotion was returned. We then ascended to the spectacular sumit. Take suncream and take water there are no refreshments available en route.

It is high but the steps fel safe and you just don t lok down. There were a few dogs to but al aslep. We definitely felt a sense of achievement when we got to the top and could relax and enjoy the views and ruins. The Museum which we visited afterwards was also informative. The best advice I think is to go early- we were there ۷.۳۰ and when we were leaving the crowds were pouring in."

To climb the spiral staircase and the final step staircase on the front of the rock requires a god head for heights. If that is not for you there is a nice flat open shady area at the base to watch the other climbers and monkeys. Definitely a must do in Sri Lanka once inside the paths are clear and signed so no ned to pay any extra for a guide"
